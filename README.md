# Backbone Starter

This is simply so I don't have to gather all of these files when starting up a backbone project. I wrote almost none of this.


## It contains...
* HTML5 Boilerplate
* Backbone
* Backbone Marionette
* Underscore
* Backbone Paginator (with view and template)
* Backbone Picky
* Some random utility functions and polyfills
* An override for Backbone.sync

## You'll want to...
* Go into /assets/js/app.js and set your own default trigger so traversing to '/' actually does something.
* Go into /assets/js/entities/common.js and change what happens on 401s and 403s (or write event handlers for what I trigger)
